## Project Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Usage Instructions

### Run Two Functions to Check User Input
There are two functions in this code.  The ask_for_input function prompts the user for an input of an alphabetical character, then Iteratively check if the input is a valid guess. The second function called check_guess passes in the variable guess as a parameter for the function to check if the guess is in a randomly chosen word from a list.
